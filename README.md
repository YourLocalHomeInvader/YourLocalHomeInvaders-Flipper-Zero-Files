<h1>My Flipper Zero Files</h1>
 <p>This is just a dump of some of the files I have created so far.</p>

<h3>Infrared</h3>
<p>Files of some remotes I copied and saved. The sanyo file for a soundbar is there because I didn't see anyone do it yet so I figured to add.</p>

<h3>NFC</h3>

<p>Just some Amiibo I have collected from others but very useful playing some games, also add me and a friends Mii is some of the Amiibo too. The NFC Tag folder is for phone that have NFC, You just place it on the back of your phone where the reader is and it should open google, on iphones it shows a warning most of the time, but for androids most of the time it doesn't show a warning it just opens the command and does it anyways without warning. I can see how someone can do some bad with it but you got to be pretty close lmao.</p>
