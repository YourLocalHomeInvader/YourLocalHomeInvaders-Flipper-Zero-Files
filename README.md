<h1>My Flipper Zero Files</h1>
 <p>This is just a dump of some of the files I have created so far.</p>

<h3>Infrared</h3>
<p>Files of some remotes I copied and saved. The sanyo file for a soundbar is there because I didn't see anyone do it yet so I figured to add.</p>

<h3>NFC</h3>
<p>Just some Amiibo I have collected from other githubs but very useful playing some games, also add me and a friend Mii is some of the Amiibo in their own folder too.</p>
